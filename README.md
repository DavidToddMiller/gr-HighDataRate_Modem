                                  gr-HighDataRate_Modem

gr-HighDataRate_Modem is a GNU Radio Out-Of-Tree (OOT) High Data Rate (HDR)_Modem module that includes the blocks required to run GNU Radio at 15.0 Mbps with QPSK. This module is based on the approach that was introduced during a GNU Radio Conference 2022 Talk and the associated paper in the GNU Radio Conference 2022 proceedings and 2022 Conference website:

    •  "Demonstration of GNU Radio High Data Rate QPSK Modem at 15.0 Mbps Real-Time with Multi-Core General Purpose Processor (GRCON 2022)"

The 2022 conference paper is also provided in the “docs” folder of this github site and provides technical details on all the Out-Of-Tree (OOT) blocks. The gr-HighDataRate_Modem design for Conference 2022 is also in the "docs" folder titled:
"gr-HighDataRate_Modem Design Document (version #1 - DRAFT).odt"

The approach with blocks in gr-HighDataRate_Modem does not require a frame counter that the 2021 Conference design required, just knowledge about the frame ASM and frame length. The details on the approach and blocks are provided in the design document in the "docs" folder.

Also, example flowgraphs are provided in the “examples” folder of this github site:
    • Sample Modulator Files in .zip format are available in the folder also to quickly run the transmit Modulator in Flowgraphs
      (up to about 40000 frames for about a 10-12 second run at 15 Mbps)
    • The original frame stream in baseband real bits before modulation is provided that can be compared to the received stream for verification that no bits or frames had errors or were lost. The first 2 frames are deleted for comparison to the received frame stream that may have the first 0-2 frames missing when running the flowgraph. 
    • The provided flowgraphs run with a frame length of 4192 bits that includes the 32 bit CCSDS ASM.  See the Design Document in the "doc" folder for all the details.  Other frame length options will be available in the future.
    • For simulation, a separate simulation .grc file for QPSK is in the "examples" folder and has a "throttle" block available for those that do not have a LimeSDR-Mini in order to try out gr-HighDataRate_Modem without the LimeSDR-Mini with QPSK.
    • For the Full RF Transmit/Receive Loop, the .grc file when LimeSDR-Mini is used is in the "examples" folder.
   
NOVEMBER 2022 NOTE: Based on questions received at the 2022 GNU Radio Conference from the audience at the end of my talk, I have included CCSDS TT&C Flowgraphs at low data rates for Phase Modulation (PM) with a subcarrier and Concatenated Coding and frame scrambling (includes handling Doppler also via FFTs) that is used extensively by many space agencies:
    • Flowgraphs located in "examples/Doppler_And_CCSDS_TTC_Flowgraphs_LowRate" Folder on this site
    • Separate flowgraphs for Transmit and Receive when using dongles
    • A couple of the encoder and decoder blocks are OOT from gr-satellites otherwise all blocks are in the standard GNU Radio library. 
    • Runs at 16 kilosymbols/second with the coding included. 64 kHz subcarrier used.
    • With the Doppler FFT functions, the flowgraphs could be used operationally in real-time for an actual Low Earth Orbit (LEO) spacecraft that uses typical CCSDS low rate TT&C links at S-band.
    • A detailed paper on the TT&C flowgraphs design with Doppler will be provided soon in the "docs" folder (expect early 2023)

                               INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE

The installation procedure of gr-HighDataRate_Modem source code is the usual procedure for a GNU Radio out-of-tree (OOT) module. The detailed instructions are as follows for building from source in a system where GNU Radio 3.10 (should work with GNU Radio version 3.9 also) has already been installed with Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 21.04:

                                DEPENDENCIES

There are some build dependencies for GNU Radio out-of-tree modules that are not required to run GNU Radio, so some distributions might not install them by default when GNU Radio is installed.

VERY IMPORTANT:  A Personal Computer with a CPU containing at least 8 Cores is required to use these blocks at the full 15.0 Mbps QPSK.  See the Conference Paper for details on the Parallel Core Approach used to greatly increase the Real-Time Data Rate capability of GNU Radio. 

                                 DOWNLOADING

The gr-HighDataRate_Modem module and blocks within the module were developed in this DavidToddMiller/gr-HighDataRate_Modem Github repository. One can use the typical github clone command in the Ubuntu terminal to download all of the needed source code folders and files for example:

“ git clone https://github.com/DavidToddMiller/gr-HighDataRate_Modem.git ”

                          BUILDING AND INSTALLING

After downloading, gr-HighDataRate_Modem can be built and installed using cmake. The following can be run inside the directory containing the gr-HighDataRate_Modem sources:

mkdir build

cd build

sudo cmake ../

sudo make

sudo make install

sudo ldconfig

                         RUNNING THE .grc FLOWGRAPHS

The .py generated file in the GNU Radio Companion should be run from the Ubuntu terminal because the files run at 
15.0 Megasamples/second with text printouts including the frame count up to about 40000 frames during about a 10-12 second run when using the included provided QPSK Modulator File in the “examples” folder of this github site. The provided QPSK Modulator File is provided for convenience, but a user can also generate their own modulator file with the provided QPSK Modulator .grc flowgraph files in the “examples/QPSK_Generate_Modulator_Files” folder of this site.

                         FUTURE WORK

1. When a 16-24 core Personal Computer becomes available, incorporate higher data rates, Doppler removal/handling, and coding.   
2. Add support for more frame lengths beyond just 4192 bit length frames
